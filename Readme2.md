This application gives the user the ability to have a strong password generated for them. The user will be prompted to put in a certain number of characters.
Then a series of questions will be asked for the user to respond okay or cancel. This gives the application guidelines for creating the password. 
The password will be shown on the screen when the user is finished answering the questions.
